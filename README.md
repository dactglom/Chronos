Dear Natalya, here you can see step by step guide of how to use this app.
First push the `clone or download button`. { It is above all the files enumerated at the main page }
Then open a console and find the project folder (use `cd` in order to get there).
When you did it, just type `npm install`;
And after all the packages have been installed, type `npm start`;
Cheers!! It must work!
